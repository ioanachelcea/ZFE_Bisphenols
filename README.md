Knime workflow and codes were written by Ioana Chelcea, Publication Title: "Physiology-informed toxicokinetic model for the zebrafish embryo test developed for bisphenols" by Ioana Chelcea, Carolina Vogs, Timo Hamers, Jacco Koekkoek, Jessica Legradi, Maria Sapounidou, Stefan Ã–rn,  Patrik L.

Repository contains 3 files: 1. Knime workflow containing models and predictions (Chelcea_2023_ZFE_git.knwf), 2. Excel file containing model parameters (ZFE_parms_KNIME.xlsx), 3. R script containing Bayesian Inference example used for model parameter calibration (ZFE_Bayes_10k_widepriors.R)

IMPORTANT: Place both KNIME workflow and Excel files in the same folder and set the local KNIME directory to that folder.

Instructions for running the KNIME workflow:

Download KKNIME workflow and Excel files in the same folder.
Open KNIME and set your local directory to that folder. (You can change your local directory under File>Switch workspaces> Browse for the folder you have the files in)
To open workflow it has to be imported. Go to File>Import KNIME workflow> Select file (Browse and select the Chelcea_2023_ZFE_git.knwf file)

Trouble shooting: Packages not found even after installing them: Check which version of R is set to use in KNIME. Using a local computer version is more suitable as packages are installed there by default. To change R version go to File>Preferences>KNIME>R> Path to R Home.
